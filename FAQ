- How to build the project?

mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true assembly:single


- The program reports precompiled.rpn file isn't there. What can I do?

Runs org.suite.PrecompileMain to perform pre-compilation. I usually run from eclipse.


- I get assertion error when running org.weiqi.UctScenarioTest.testCapture() test case. What can I do?

The UCT algorithm involves randomity, therefore not every execution can be end up in the best result.
Run the test case again, and it may end up success. Or just ignore that test case.


- I get stack overflow error when running org.instructionexecutor test cases. What can I do?

Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Installed JREs -> (Your JRE)
-> Edit -> Default VM Arguments -> Enter "-Xss1m"
